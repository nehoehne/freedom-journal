Organizing components in the file structure of an Angular project is an important part of building scalable and maintainable applications. Here are some common practices for organizing components in Angular:

1. **Feature-based folders**: One common approach is to organize components based on the features they belong to. For example, you might have a `user` folder for components related to user management, a `product` folder for components related to product management, and so on. Each feature folder might contain one or more components, as well as any associated services, models, and other files.
2. **Smart and dumb components**: Another approach is to organize components based on their role in the application. Smart components (also called container components) are responsible for managing state and logic, while dumb components (also called presentational components) are responsible for rendering UI based on inputs. Smart components might be placed in a `containers` folder, while dumb components might be placed in a `components` folder.
3. **Routing-based folders**: If your application has complex routing, you might choose to organize components based on the routes they belong to. For example, you might have a `home` folder for components related to the home route, a `profile` folder for components related to the profile route, and so on. Each route folder might contain one or more components, as well as any associated services, models, and other files.
4. **Shared components**: If you have components that are used in multiple parts of the application, you might choose to place them in a `shared` folder. This can help prevent duplication of code and make it easier to maintain shared components.

Regardless of which approach you choose, it's important to be consistent in your naming conventions and file structure. This can help make your code easier to understand and maintain over time.

Here's an example of a possible file structure for an Angular project:
```javascript
src
├── app
│   ├── core
│   │   ├── guards
│   │   ├── interceptors
│   │   ├── services
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── shared
│   │   ├── components
│   │   ├── directives
│   │   ├── pipes
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── features
│   │   ├── user
│   │   │   ├── user.module.ts
│   │   │   ├── user-routing.module.ts
│   │   │   ├── user-list
│   │   │   │   ├── user-list.component.ts
│   │   │   │   ├── user-list.component.html
│   │   │   │   ├── user-list.component.scss
│   │   │   │   └── ...
│   │   │   ├── user-details
│   │   │   │   ├── user-details.component.ts
│   │   │   │   ├── user-details.component.html
│   │   │   │   ├── user-details.component.scss
│   │   │   │   └── ...
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   ├── product
│   │   ├── order
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── app.module.ts
│   ├── app-routing.module.ts
│   ├── app.component.ts
│   ├── app.component.html
│   └── ...
├── assets
├── environments
└── ...
```
In this example, the `core` folder contains services, guards, and other files that are used throughout the application. The `shared` folder contains components, directives, and other files that are shared between multiple features. The `features` folder contains one or more feature modules, each with its own set of components, services, and other files. The `app` folder contains the root module and root component of the application, as well as any associated files. The `assets` and `environments` folders are used for storing static assets and environment-specific configurations, respectively.
