In an Angular/Electron project, the Electron-specific code should be kept separate from the Angular code to maintain a clear separation of concerns. Here's a common structure for an Angular/Electron project:
```markdown
- my-app
  - e2e
  - node_modules
  - src
    - app
    - assets
    - environments
    - main.ts (Angular's main bootstrap file)
    - index.html
  - electron
    - main.js (Electron's main process file)
    - preload.js (Electron's preload script)
  - package.json
  - angular.json
  - ...
```
In this structure, the `src` directory contains the Angular application code, while the `electron` directory contains the Electron-specific code.

The `main.js` file in the `electron` directory is the entry point for the Electron application. This is where you initialize Electron, create the application window, and handle Electron-specific tasks.

The `preload.js` file is used to selectively expose Node.js and Electron APIs to the renderer process. This is a recommended practice for security reasons.

The `package.json` file in the root directory is used to manage your application's dependencies and scripts. This is where you specify your Electron dependency and any scripts related to Electron, such as scripts to start or package your application.

The `angular.json` file in the root directory is Angular's configuration file. You might need to update this file to include additional build steps for Electron.

This structure is just a convention and can vary depending on your application's needs. The key point is to keep your Electron and Angular code separate to maintain a clear separation of concerns.

In summary, you should put your Electron code in a separate directory (such as `electron`) outside of the `src` directory, which contains your Angular application code. This helps to maintain a clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to manage your application's dependencies and scripts.
